github_watcher
==============

Github Watcher is a daemon that monitors the files, line ranges, regular expression matches, and directories in a repository you configure it to watch. When there is a pull request sent to that repository making a change to something you're watching; you'll get a Desktop Notification in Linux and OSX. There is no support in Windows. There's also a really annoying voice that tells you what was found.

Find all the documentation on the [Read the Docs](https://github-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page.
